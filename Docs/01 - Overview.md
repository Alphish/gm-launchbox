# Overview

**Launchbox** is a library for scheduling and running initialisation tasks.

The system is centered around launch boxes, gathering the tasks to run and executing them upon request. You can read more on the [Launch Boxes page](/Docs/02%20-%20Launch%20Boxes.md).

Additionally, the library provides a set of functions to access, manage and launch the launch boxes. They're described in more detail on the [Functions page](/Docs/03%20-%20Functions.md).

You can also check out various use cases on the [Example Scenarios page](/Docs/04%20-%20Example%20Scenarios.md).
